# 🧠 Entry-Level PHP Programmer Checklist

This checklist outlines the essential skills and concepts for becoming an entry-level PHP developer. Each item includes a brief explanation to help you understand its purpose and importance.

---

## ✅ Core PHP Fundamentals

- [ ] **PHP syntax and data types** – Learn how PHP code is written and the types of data it handles (e.g., strings, integers, arrays).
- [ ] **Operators** – Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators (`+`, `==`, `&&`) to manipulate and evaluate data.
- [ ] **Conditional statements** – Control the flow of your program using `if`, `else`, and `switch`.
- [ ] **Loops** – Repeat actions using `for`, `while`, and `foreach`, especially useful for working with arrays.
- [ ] **Functions** – Create reusable blocks of code to simplify and organize your logic.
- [ ] **Variable scope** – Understand where variables can be accessed (local vs global).
- [ ] **Built-in functions** – Use PHP’s built-in tools like `strlen()`, `array_push()`, and more.
- [ ] **Error handling** – Use `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to manage exceptions and prevent crashes.
- [ ] **Debugging** – Use `var_dump()`, `print_r()`, and error logs to troubleshoot issues.

## 🗂️ Forms and User Input

- [ ] **GET vs POST** – Understand the difference between sending data via URL (`GET`) vs hidden form data (`POST`).
- [ ] **Accessing form data** – Use `$_GET` and `$_POST` to retrieve user input.
- [ ] **Validation and sanitization** – Ensure user input is correct and safe before using it.
- [ ] **Sessions and cookies** – Store user data across pages (e.g., login status, preferences).

## 🗃️ File Handling and Data Storage

- [ ] **File operations** – Read and write files using `fopen()`, `fwrite()`, and `fread()`.
- [ ] **Session data** – Save temporary user info during a visit using `$_SESSION`.
- [ ] **Database connection** – Connect to MySQL using `mysqli` or `PDO`.
- [ ] **SQL queries** – Perform basic operations like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- [ ] **Prepared statements** – Prevent SQL injection by safely sending data to the database.

---

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- [ ] **Classes and objects** – Create reusable blueprints and instantiate objects.
- [ ] **Properties and methods** – Define variables and functions inside classes.
- [ ] **Constructors** – Initialize object properties when an object is created.
- [ ] **Inheritance and visibility** – Share code between classes and control access with `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

## 🌐 Web Development Basics

- [ ] **HTML/CSS** – Structure and style your web pages.
- [ ] **JavaScript basics** – Add interactivity like form validation or dynamic content.
- [ ] **Embedding PHP in HTML** – Mix PHP code into your HTML files for dynamic pages.
- [ ] **Request-response cycle** – Understand how browsers and servers communicate.
- [ ] **Routing and URLs** – Handle different pages and actions based on the URL.

---

## 🛠️ Development Tools & Practices

- [ ] **Local environment setup** – Use XAMPP, MAMP, or Docker to run PHP locally.
- [ ] **Git version control** – Track changes and collaborate using Git.
- [ ] **GitHub** – Store and share your code online.
- [ ] **Debugging tools** – Use browser dev tools and PHP error logs.
- [ ] **Clean code** – Write readable, well-organized code with comments.
- [ ] **MVC basics** – Learn the Model-View-Controller pattern to structure larger projects.

---

## 📦 Bonus Skills (Optional but Valuable)

- [ ] **Composer** – Manage project dependencies and libraries.
- [ ] **PHP frameworks** – Explore Laravel, CodeIgniter, or others to build apps faster.
- [ ] **REST APIs** – Connect your app to external services (e.g., weather, payments).
